        <h2>Mitigating Corporate Information Exposure on the Web</h2>
          <section>
          <h3>Introduction </h3>
          <p>Corporate information exposure on the web can lead to large financial and social loss for companies. Exposure can occur due to human error, malicious intent and system weaknesses.  This literature review explores various journals and studies done by academics in  the field of web and information security, and discusses the techniques of ensuring information security such as: employee training, risk assessments and ensuring effective vulnerability  scanners  are  used.

          <h3>Human factors </h3>
          <p>Human errors amongst employees in organisations can  lead  to  exposure  of  corporate information.  Safa  and  Maple’s  (2016)  report  presents  an  examination  of human  errors  in  the field of information security, and  identified  the following  threats:  lack  of  awareness,  social engineering and seeking information, and the following solutions: conscious care behaviour, organisational policies, knowledge-sharing and security collaboration. Whether the mistakes are  intentional  or  unintentional,  actions  from  employees  can  lead to major losses for companies,  both  economically  and socially. Ensuring employees have awareness of the risks  of  information  exposure,  is  an important factor in assuring information  security, therefore  managers  providing  training  to  their   employees is essential to improve the user's’ awareness  ( Safa  &  Maple,  2016 ,  p17).

          <p>A supporting study by Safa et al (2015) on security  conscious  behaviour  reports  that “Information  security  conscious  care  behaviour  decreases the  risk  of  information  breaches when the area of weakness is human behaviour.” (Safa et al., 2015, p76). The results of their study revealed  that  perceived  behaviour  control  does  not  affect  a  user's  conscious behaviour a significant amount, therefore  it  is  recommended that  management  inform employees of the significance of having  a  careful  attitude,  and  inform  them  of  the  threats  if conscious care is not executed (Safa et  al.,  2015).

          <p>Safa and Maple (2016) also highlighted social  engineering  as  a threat to corporate information  security.  Social  engineering  is  the  psychological  manipulation  of  individuals  to make  them  reveal  confidential  information and perform certain  acts.  This is commonly done over  the  telephone  or  by  people  in  disguise  as  workers,  such as   technicians (Safa & Maple, 2016,  p18).

          <p>The idea of social engineering as a factor in human  error  is  supported  by  Krombholzes (2015)  journal  on  advanced  social  engineering  attacks.  As  well  as  social  and  technical approaches this article also highlights the possibility of  reverse  social  engineering,  which  is when an attacker makes the victim  believe  they are a trustworthy person. They then go on to manipulate the victim so they can access the victim's system, where they can therefore have access to  the company's confidential information (Krombholz et al., 2015, p115).

          <p>Yeboah-Boateng and Boaten (2016) highlighted the problem of ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD),  which  is  a  common  occurrence  in  organisations  where  employees  use  their  own computing devices  on  the network of the company. They found that companies barely incorporated  any  security  measures  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  information  exposure,  when using  a  BYOD  system.  Subsequently they recommend that management  keeps  a  closer record of activity through the network, to ensure that carelessness from employees  does  not lead to company information exposure or data loss (Yeboah-Boateng & Boaten, 2016).

          <p>As well as accidental human error, Padayachee (2016) suggests that insider attacks are a large factor in corporate  information  exposure  ( Padayachee,  2016 ,  p47).  The  Cybersecurity Watch Survey reported that 46% of respondents to the survey considered the damage caused  by  insider  attacks  more  severe  than   external attacks (Software Engineering Institute:
          Carnegie  Mellon  University,  2012).  However,  a  conflicting  piece  of research  by  the Boardroom Cyber Watch survey found  that  the  percentage  to  be  higher  than  originally suggested, with over 50% of participants finding insider attacks more severe (IT Governance,  2014).

          <p>The current system analysis, a review involving mapping and collating of information in a systematic manner, suggests Structure Conduct Performance (SCP) theory to catalogue information  security  increasing  techniques.  SCP  theory  categorises  five  opportunity  reducing measures  which are: ‘increase risks’,  ‘increase  effort’,  ‘reduce  provocation’,  ‘reduce  rewards’, and ‘remove excuse’ (Padayachee, 2016, p48).

          <p>A contrasting approach to insider threat mitigation uses the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) risk assessment as a method of explaining  predatory  crimes.  The  main  features  of  RAT  are inertia,  visibility,  value,  accessibility, and absence  of  guardians  ( Cohen  &  Felson,  1979). A research  study  applied  the  idea  of  RAT  to  information  security  systems  conceptualizes  and operationalizes  the  main  constructs  of  RAT,  and  found  that  RAT  based  risk assessment and mitigation  approaches  are  useful  in  the  combatting  of  insider  threats  ( Jinguo,  Gupta  & Rao, 2015.  p91-92).

          <h3>System factors </h3>
          <p>Other than quantifying psychological risks for human error and  attacks,  risk level estimation on  a  network  is  essential  to threat  mitigation.  Singh,  Joshi,  and  Gaud  (2016)  proposed  a framework  for  the  level  of  risk  estimation.  This  framework  uses  the  Common  Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the National  Institute  of  Standards  and Technology (NIST) National  Vulnerability  Database  ( NVD)  to   estimate security risk level to ensure security management.  ( Singh,  Joshi  &  Gaud,  2016 ,  p37).

          <p>A related study by a Joshi and Singh (2016), which assessed the efficiency of web application  vulnerability  scanners,  discusses  the  importance  of  prioritisation  of estimating risk levels in web applications (Joshi, Singh, 2016. P1). Chong, Vikram, and Myers’ (2007) designed  and  implemented  Servlet Information Flow (SIF) which is a framework for developing  high-assurance  web  applications.  Applications which employed the SIF framework  are  amongst  the  first  to  statically   enforce strong confidentiality and integrity policies.  This allowed for a larger use of information flow control. (Chong, Vikram & Myers,
          2007).

          <p>However, El-Hajj et al. (2016) suggest an approach that directly interacts with the database of  the  web  application  rather  than  the  code.  SIF  was  built  using  JIF  to  address  security issues  when  producing  multi-tier  web  applications  but  ignores  the database  tier,  whereas El-Hajj’s  approach  uses extended Program Dependence Graph (EPDG) to associate database  attributes  and  security  annotations.  This  framework  showed  a  high  success  rate  in preventing security  flaws  ( El-Hajj  et  al.,  2016 ,  p151).
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>In conclusion human  error  was  found  to  be  the  larger  factor  in  corporate  information exposure, and training techniques  based on previous psychological research, have been shown to give awareness about how attitudes and actions have an effect on the security of company  information.  The  importance  of  risk  assessments  was  also highlighted  as  key,  as that allows for the prevention of security breaches on a network or application. The concept of  web  applications  employing EPDG methods was found to be more effective than the previous techniques using SIF for web application security.
